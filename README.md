How-to-Run Guide

Libraries used: Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy.stats
We have saved all csv files under the data folder. Some of the csv files, we cleaned up using Microsoft Excel. We used filter, vlookup, and pivot table. The depression csv file is saved as Adults_Depression_S.csv, suicide csv file is saved as Suicide.csv, and physical activity is saved as Physical_activity.csv.
Our main project is under the project folder, under suicide folder. All of the work related to depression data is done under Depression.ipynb, and the suicide data is under Suicide.ipynb. Suicide_Depression.ipynb was added to look for relationship between depression rates and suicide rates.
All the graphs we have created have been saved under images folder. 

For the graphs used to create our animated plots, see Creating_Gif_Data. Each folder is labeled under its respected graph. The csv used to create the graphs is under gif for project. Code to create the indivisual plots is under Code for gif.ipynb

Project Summary
Analysis of suicide and depression rates by US states to observe if they are related to the level of physical activity of the population for the years 2018 to 2020.

Research questions we wanted to answer
1) How do depression and suicide rates differ by states
2) which states have the highest or lowest suicide rates, depression, physical activity rates
3) If there is any correlation between the physical activity and depression/suicide rates

Observation
Both depression and suicide rates shared similar pattern for years 2018, 2019, 2020
Both depression and suicide rates differ greatly by states in 2020

The graph for depression rates by state over the years of 2018-2020 shared a similar pattern, and the graph for suicide rates by state over the years of 2018-2020 also showed a similiar pattern, so we thought it would be safe to choose the year of 2000 as an example to analyze our data when comparing to physical activity/inactivity data.

The highest depression rates were seen in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Arkansas. Whereas, the lowest rates were shown in the states of Hawaii, California, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey in 2020.


The highest suicide rates were seen in the states of Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, New Mexico, and Idaho. Whereas the lowest rates were shown in the states of New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maryland in 2020
New Jersey is the only state with the lowest depression and suicide rates.

The highest physical activity rates were seen in states of Kentucky, Mississippi, and Arkansas whereas the lowest rates were shown in states of Utah, Colorado, and Washington in 2020

Physical inactivity does not show an impact on depression rates in adults living in the US for 2020
Physical inactivity does not show an impact on suicide rates in adults living in the US for 2020
Physical inactivity does not show an impact on suicide rates in adults living in the US for 2019
The average physical activity does not show an impact on suicide rates in adults living in the US for 2019

Conclusion
There was no correlation between depression rate and physical activity nor between suicide rate and physical activity
